# Color Flipper
Change the colors of the text or the background by clicking on the buttons. You can also apply the selected color to the rest of the page to see how it fits.

## About the project
A simple project just to practice Vanilla Javascript :)

I also applyed some responsivity to the project.

## Main JavaScript concepts used in the project:

- array manipulation
- array.length
- document.getElementById()
- document.querySelector()
- addEventListener()
- document.body.style.backgroundColor and others like this
- Math.random()
- importing and reading json file

## References
Main idea from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=421s)! 
The 'hex page' is quite similar to reference project but I used the 'simple colors' page to explore a little bit of the content shown in the video and I loved it! It was the first time I changed HTML elemnts styles using DOM manipulation.
